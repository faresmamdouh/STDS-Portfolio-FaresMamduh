# Reflection – Task 01

## What I Learned
Through this task, I learned how to design a complete analytical dashboard using Excel.  
I improved my skills in using pivot tables, KPI cards, and charts to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

## What Was Challenging
One of the main challenges was organizing the large dataset and choosing the most relevant metrics to display.  
Balancing visual clarity with detailed information also required careful design decisions.

## What I Improved From Previous Tasks

I also became more confident in transforming raw data into professional visual reports.
