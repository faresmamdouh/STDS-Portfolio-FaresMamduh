# Reflection – Task 02

## What I Learned
In this task, I learned how to build multi-layer dashboards that combine high-level business metrics with detailed product analysis.  
I gained experience in analyzing profitability, inventory levels, and sales trends across time and regions.

## What Was Challenging
The main challenge was managing multiple dimensions such as time, geography, and product hierarchy while keeping the dashboards easy to understand.  
Designing effective slicers without overwhelming the dashboard required careful planning.

## What I Improved From Previous Tasks
Compared to Task 01, I improved my ability to design structured dashboards with clear analytical focus.  
I also enhanced my skills in KPI selection, profitability analysis, and storytelling through data visualization.
